README file for CDAO

CDAO (Comparative Data Analysis Ontology) is an ontology for use in the evolutionary analysis of biological data.  The ontology is represented in OWL-DL (Ontology Web Language with Description Logics). 

CDAO includes concepts that represent phylogenetic trees, as well as the character-state data model.  The character-state data model is an entity-attribute-value model in which the entities are biological entities such as genes, proteins, or species, typically referred to as OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units), the attributes are called "Characters", and the value of an attribute for a given entity is called the "State" or "Character state", e.g., in a protein alignment, the proteins are the entities, the alignment columns are the attributes, and the values are the residues specified by row and column.  

CDAO is being developed by the Evolutionary Informatics working group of the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (www.nescent.org).  Key developers include Brandon Chisham, Francisco Prosdocimi, Julie Thompson, Enrico Pontelli, and Arlin Stoltzfus.
